                <h2>CHVote : a public system, Swiss and open source</h2>
                <p>The electronic voting system CHVote is a concrete answer and a real breakthrough in digital technology and
                    e-government.</p>
                <p>This system is the fruit of a <em>partnership</em> between the State Chancellery and the General Directorate of
                    Information
                    Systems (DGSI) of the Department of Security and Economy (DSE) of the Geneva Canton.</p>
                <p>The State of Geneva is pioneering in the e-voting domain with over <em>100 polls</em> successfully accomplished since
                    2003.
                </p>
                <p>CHVote, entirely developed, hosted and operated by the Geneva Canton is today one of only two accredited electronic voting systems by the Federal
                    Council in Switzerland. It is offered to nearly <em>125’000 voters in 4 cantons</em> (Geneva, Bern, Lucerne and Basel),
                    as much for voting as for electing at the communal, cantonal and federal levels. It also allows people with disabilities to
                    participate in the polls.</p>

                <h2>Transparency and security, a priority</h2>
                <p>
                    Since 2010, the Geneva citizens have been granted access to the source code on a written request to the State Council.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On January 29th 2016, the Grand Council, on a proposal from the State Council, unanimously adopted a modification of the
                    law on the exercise of political rights (<a href="https://www.ge.ch/legislation/rsg/f/rsg_a5_05.html">LEDP</a>), which makes it compulsory to publish on internet the source code of the
                    electronic voting system.
                </p>
                <p>The State of Geneva wishes to <em>increase electorate confidence</em> in a <em>transparent and secure system</em>.
                    Indeed, the maximum transparency in matters of political law and e-voting is a priority for the Geneva Canton.</p>
                <p>Since March 8th 2015, CHVote has become a so-called <em>second generation</em> system with security requirements laid
                    down by the Swiss Confederation (individual verifiability).</p>
